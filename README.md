## Project Overview
The main objective was to ensure the campus's network infrastructure could integrate seamlessly with the additional network requirements of the Olympiad without compromising ongoing operations. This involved detailed planning to identify suitable locations within the campus for the event, determining the subnetting requirements, and assessing the number of hosts to support.

## Approach and Methodology
The project was divided into several key phases:
1. **Introduction and Planning**: Understanding the context of the Mexican Informatics Olympiad and setting clear objectives for the network design and optimization.
2. **Problem Statement and Scope Definition**: Detailed analysis of the requirements, including space allocation, budget estimation, and the identification of required devices and their placement following structured cabling standards.
3. **Solution Proposal**: This involved the selection of equipment, logical and physical network design, subnetting based on VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking), and detailed cost analysis.
4. **Implementation and Testing**: Setting up the network infrastructure, configuring network devices, and performing connectivity tests to ensure reliability and performance.
5. **Evaluation and Conclusion**: Assessing the project outcomes against the objectives and identifying areas for future improvements.

## Results and Conclusions
The project successfully met the objectives of designing a cost-effective and high-performing network infrastructure. Through careful planning and execution, the team managed to overcome challenges related to router configurations and subnet calculations. The connectivity tests confirmed the network's readiness for the event, demonstrating its capability to support a large number of hosts with varied requirements.

## Future Work
The project has laid a strong foundation for future technology events at Tecnológico de Monterrey, Campus Puebla. The experience gained and the methodologies applied can be used to further enhance the campus's network infrastructure for upcoming challenges.
